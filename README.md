Pre-requisites:

-   [powershell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell)
-   [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
-   [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/)
-   [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd)

## Commands

The following rules are provided by the [Makefile](Makefile):

-   clean: Delete the entire build directory (for deployment, perhaps)
-   purge: Delete intermediate object (.o) files
-   scaffold: Create empty directories to store the build artifacts
-   build: Build the object files and executables
-   run: Run the executables in ascending order
-   all: Shorthand for build and run

## Notes

The Makefile has been carefully curated and optimized to work on Windows platforms.
Only changed source code files will be recompiled upon `make build`.

> Please **DO NOT** use directory names in source code file names (i.e. src/hello/hello.c).
> This is crucial as the Makefile uses pattern matching to recompile changed files.
> Having directory names as substrings of the source code file names will result in
> frequent but unnecessary re-compiling.

> Please **DO NOT** include a `main` function in the immediate source directory.
> Each section (E.g. src/1, src/2) should have its own main function.
> Only utility functions should abide in the top-level source directory.
> The Makefile will automatically link the utility files for all sections to access.
